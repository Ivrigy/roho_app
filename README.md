## Overview

Roho Booking Service is the secret weapon for event managers and creative agencies who need to book staff ‚Äî and book them *fast*. Whether you‚Äôre curating a gallery opening, orchestrating a fair, or just trying to fill seats at your next big show, Roho‚Äôs got your back. Think of it as Tinder for top-notch event staff (minus the awkward swiping).

**Target Audience:**  
- üè¢ Agencies that organize events  
- üé® Art directors and gallery curators  
- üéâ Fair and festival coordinators  
- ‚Äçüíº Anyone who has ever said, ‚ÄúWhy is booking people so complicated?‚Äù  

## UX Design

### Strategy plane
I originally designed Roho as a full talent marketplace with multi-service booking, profiles, ratings, messaging, and availability calendars. Because of the timeline, I applied Agile scoping and shipped an MVP that solves the essential job end-to-end: discover the service, submit a booking, review or edit or delete it, and let an admin triage entries. The larger concept stays on the roadmap.

### Site goals
- Deliver a fast, low-friction path from landing to confirmed booking
- Keep the interface predictable and consistent on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Use high contrast and clear hierarchy for easy reading
- Give admins simple oversight to keep data clean
- Leave room for growth without redesigning the core

### Scope and Agile decisions (MVP)
- Kept: authentication, Offer ‚Üí Booking flow, My Bookings with CRUD, basic admin visibility
- Deferred: staff profiles, messaging, calendar availability, quotes, multi-tenant agencies
- Process: very small user stories with acceptance criteria, Kanban flow, demoable increments

### User Stories

### Admin / business owner
- As an admin, I want to view all bookings so that I can manage schedules and data integrity.
- As an admin, I want to edit or delete any booking so that I can correct mistakes or remove duplicates.
- As an admin, I want to manage service categories so that I can adjust the offer.

### Visitor / guest
- As a visitor, I want to understand the service at a glance so that I know if this solves my problem.
- As a visitor, I want to see clear navigation to Book Now and Register so that I can start immediately.
- As a visitor, I want responsive pages on mobile, tablet, and desktop so that I can use the site anywhere.

### New user
- As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can submit bookings.
- As a new user, I want helpful form hints and validation so that I can complete registration without confusion.

### Logged-in user
- As a user, I want to log in and out reliably so that my account stays secure.
- As a user, I want to choose a service from the Offer page and go straight to the correct booking form so that I don‚Äôt get lost.
- As a user, I want to submit a booking with event details, dates, and number of people so that the team can staff my event.
- As a user, I want the form to prevent past dates and enforce start before end so that my booking is valid.
- As a user, I want a clear confirmation after submitting so that I know it worked.
- As a user, I want to see my bookings in My Bookings so that I can review the status at any time.
- As a user, I want to edit an existing booking with the form prefilled so that I can fix small mistakes quickly.
- As a user, I want to delete a booking I no longer need so that I don‚Äôt clutter the system.

### UX research and market scan
  
I wanted to understand how event-staffing and booking platforms set expectations: what fields they ask for, how fast you can submit a request, how they communicate availability and pricing, and where users typically drop off.

sample and method  
I did a comparative teardown of agency sites, self-serve booking tools, and marketplace job boards across Germany/EU/US. I captured flows, forms, copy, and visual patterns, then tagged everything by friction level, clarity, and mobile behavior.  
![Competitive scan](static/images/docs/comparison.png)

key patterns I saw
- most ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù flows ask for too many fields, especially before trust is built
- mobile usability varies a lot; some forms are cramped and error handling is vague

what I adopted
- one clear path: Offer ‚Üí Booking form ‚Üí confirmation
- minimal required fields with strong hints and inline validation

### Information architecture
- Navbar: Home ‚Ä¢ Book Now ‚Ä¢ My Bookings ‚Ä¢ Login or Logout
- Primary flows:
  1) Offer ‚Üí Booking form ‚Üí confirmation
  2) My Bookings ‚Üí edit or delete
  3) Admin at /admin ‚Üí review and clean up
- Copy: short action labels and one clear CTA per section

### Wireframes and design evolution
- Wireframes: a simple path from Home to Book to My Bookings with centered forms and visible CTAs  
  ![Wireframes](/static/images/docs/wireframes.png)

- Early MVP screens: Offer cards, Booking form, Sign-up/Sign-in, and My Bookings list  
  ![MVP Screens](/static/images/docs/Booking.png)

- First large landing concept (pre-scope cut): editorial hero blocks, multiple service areas, and a banner callout  
  ![Initial Landing Concept](/static/images/docs/rohohomepage.png)

I trimmed the large landing to keep speed and clarity for the MVP while keeping the visual language ready for future expansion.

### Visual design and color system

I chose a modern, high-contrast palette so actions are easy to notice and the interface works well for users who need more contrast.
- Pitch black: application background for maximum contrast
- White: primary text on dark
- Electric or mint green: primary CTAs, focus rings, active accents
- Soft violet: secondary accents, icons, card tints
- Brand accent: highlights, badges, emphasis states
- Dark greys: elevated panels and form surfaces over black

Contrast and accessibility
- Body text on dark meets WCAG 2.2 AA targets; large CTAs exceed minimums
- Focus rings are clearly visible on all interactive elements
- Icons are always paired with text or an aria-label to avoid color-only cues

### Interaction and validation
- Date pickers block past dates and enforce start not after end on both client and server
- Required fields are validated inline and errors are announced to assistive tech
- After submit, the confirmation keeps context and offers a clear next step

## Agile methodology
I worked in a simple Kanban flow (To do ‚Üí In progress ‚Üí Done) using GitHub Issues and a GitHub Projects board. I kept stories small with acceptance criteria, merged related work into epics, and aimed for a fast MVP, then iteration.

process
- planned user stories on the board (To do ‚Üí In progress ‚Üí Done)
- wrote acceptance criteria first, then adjusted tasks after the first implementation spike
- shipped in short increments to Heroku and noted a tiny retro each time (keep, change, try)
- used MoSCoW to keep scope honest

epics I used
- auth and sessions
- booking flow (offer cards, form, validation, confirmation)
- my bookings (list, edit, delete)
- admin operations (manage bookings via Django admin, cleanup, light exports)
- accessibility and performance (contrast, focus rings, asset sizing)
- platform setup and deployment (installation, project setup, Heroku deploy)
- foundational UI (home/landing page and navigation)

example user story and acceptance criteria
- as a user I can select a booking service, fill the form, and send my inquiry so that I can receive the service I need
  - acceptance criterion 1: the booking offer is visible and reachable
  - acceptance criterion 2: the form validates and submits correctly
  - acceptance criterion 3: after submit, the booking appears in My Bookings

prioritisation (MoSCoW)
- must have: authentication, Offer ‚Üí Booking flow, My Bookings CRUD, basic admin visibility
- should have: category management in admin, clearer field hints, high-contrast theme and keyboard navigation
- could have: quick quotes, saved organizations, better exports, richer empty states
- won‚Äôt have in this release: messaging, staff profiles/ratings, availability calendars, multi-tenant features

## Testing

Testing was woven into every step of Roho‚Äôs development ‚Äî because ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù isn‚Äôt a QA strategy. While we didn‚Äôt write Django `TestCase` unit tests (yet), **manual testing drove the project to rock-solid reliability**.

### Manual Testing Overview

- **Authentication Workflow**  
  - Registration, login, logout, and session persistence  
  - Navbar links updating correctly for logged-in vs. guest users  
- **Booking System**  
  - Create, read, update, and delete bookings  
  - Date-picker validation (no time machines allowed ‚Äî past dates are blocked)  
- **Form & UX Validation**  
  - JavaScript checks for required fields, valid staff counts, and future dates  
  - Backend re-validation in Django to catch anything that slipped past the client  
- **Navigation & Layout**  
  - Consistent header/footer across all pages  
  - Responsive behavior on desktop, tablet, and (lightning-fast) mobile

### üêç Python (PEP 8)
- **Linting:** Used **flake8** and VS Code‚Äôs built-in linter to enforce style.  
- **Checks performed:**  
  - Maximum line length  
  - Proper function/class names (snake_case & CamelCase)  
  - Consistent indentation and whitespace  
  - Removal of unused imports and variables  

### üìú JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Validation:** Ran **JSHint** (configured with `esversion: 6`) on all custom scripts.  
- **Checks performed:**  
  - No undefined variables  
  - Required semicolons (where needed)  
  - Logical flow and syntax correctness  

### üåê HTML5 & CSS3
- **HTML:** Passed through the **W3C Markup Validator** ‚Äî only minor warnings about self-closing tags.  
- **CSS:** Verified with the **W3C CSS Validator** ‚Äî zero errors; responsive media queries all clear.  
- **Responsive rules:** Ensured flexible layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Kanban Board

- **Why it matters:**  
  - Keeps the team aligned on what‚Äôs next  
  - Highlights bottlenecks (‚ÄúWhy is nothing in Review?!‚Äù)  
  - Turns project madness into a satisfying card shuffle  

Not really satisfied with it.
