## Overview

Roho Booking Service is the secret weapon for event managers and creative agencies who need to book staff ‚Äî and book them *fast*. Whether you‚Äôre curating a gallery opening, orchestrating a fair, or just trying to fill seats at your next big show, Roho‚Äôs got your back. Think of it as Tinder for top-notch event staff (minus the awkward swiping).

**Target Audience:**  
- üè¢ Agencies that organize events  
- üé® Art directors and gallery curators  
- üéâ Fair and festival coordinators  
- ‚Äçüíº Anyone who has ever said, ‚ÄúWhy is booking people so complicated?‚Äù  

## UX Design

### Strategy plane
I originally designed Roho as a full talent marketplace with multi-service booking, profiles, ratings, messaging, and availability calendars. Because of the timeline, I applied Agile scoping and shipped an MVP that solves the essential job end-to-end: discover the service, submit a booking, review or edit or delete it, and let an admin triage entries. The larger concept stays on the roadmap.

### Site goals
- Deliver a fast, low-friction path from landing to confirmed booking
- Keep the interface predictable and consistent on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Use high contrast and clear hierarchy for easy reading
- Give admins simple oversight to keep data clean
- Leave room for growth without redesigning the core

### Scope and Agile decisions (MVP)
- Kept: authentication, Offer ‚Üí Booking flow, My Bookings with CRUD, basic admin visibility
- Deferred: staff profiles, messaging, calendar availability, quotes, multi-tenant agencies
- Process: very small user stories with acceptance criteria, Kanban flow, demoable increments

### User Stories

### Admin / business owner
- As an admin, I want to view all bookings so that I can manage schedules and data integrity.
- As an admin, I want to edit or delete any booking so that I can correct mistakes or remove duplicates.
- As an admin, I want to manage service categories so that I can adjust the offer.

### Visitor / guest
- As a visitor, I want to understand the service at a glance so that I know if this solves my problem.
- As a visitor, I want to see clear navigation to Book Now and Register so that I can start immediately.
- As a visitor, I want responsive pages on mobile, tablet, and desktop so that I can use the site anywhere.

### New user
- As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can submit bookings.
- As a new user, I want helpful form hints and validation so that I can complete registration without confusion.

### Logged-in user
- As a user, I want to log in and out reliably so that my account stays secure.
- As a user, I want to choose a service from the Offer page and go straight to the correct booking form so that I don‚Äôt get lost.
- As a user, I want to submit a booking with event details, dates, and number of people so that the team can staff my event.
- As a user, I want the form to prevent past dates and enforce start before end so that my booking is valid.
- As a user, I want a clear confirmation after submitting so that I know it worked.
- As a user, I want to see my bookings in My Bookings so that I can review the status at any time.
- As a user, I want to edit an existing booking with the form prefilled so that I can fix small mistakes quickly.
- As a user, I want to delete a booking I no longer need so that I don‚Äôt clutter the system.

### UX research and market scan
  
I wanted to understand how event-staffing and booking platforms set expectations: what fields they ask for, how fast you can submit a request, how they communicate availability and pricing, and where users typically drop off.

sample and method  
I did a comparative teardown of agency sites, self-serve booking tools, and marketplace job boards across Germany/EU/US. I captured flows, forms, copy, and visual patterns, then tagged everything by friction level, clarity, and mobile behavior.  
![Competitive scan](static/images/docs/comparison.png)

key patterns I saw
- most ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù flows ask for too many fields, especially before trust is built
- mobile usability varies a lot; some forms are cramped and error handling is vague

what I adopted
- one clear path: Offer ‚Üí Booking form ‚Üí confirmation
- minimal required fields with strong hints and inline validation

### Information architecture
- Navbar: Home ‚Ä¢ Book Now ‚Ä¢ My Bookings ‚Ä¢ Login or Logout
- Primary flows:
  1) Offer ‚Üí Booking form ‚Üí confirmation
  2) My Bookings ‚Üí edit or delete
  3) Admin at /admin ‚Üí review and clean up
- Copy: short action labels and one clear CTA per section

### Wireframes and design evolution
- Wireframes: a simple path from Home to Book to My Bookings with centered forms and visible CTAs  
  ![Wireframes](/static/images/docs/wireframes.png)

- Early MVP screens: Offer cards, Booking form, Sign-up/Sign-in, and My Bookings list  
  ![MVP Screens](/static/images/docs/Booking.png)

- First large landing concept (pre-scope cut): editorial hero blocks, multiple service areas, and a banner callout  
  ![Initial Landing Concept](/static/images/docs/rohohomepage.png)

I trimmed the large landing to keep speed and clarity for the MVP while keeping the visual language ready for future expansion.

### Visual design and color system

I chose a modern, high-contrast palette so actions are easy to notice and the interface works well for users who need more contrast.
- Pitch black: application background for maximum contrast
- White: primary text on dark
- Electric or mint green: primary CTAs, focus rings, active accents
- Soft violet: secondary accents, icons, card tints
- Brand accent: highlights, badges, emphasis states
- Dark greys: elevated panels and form surfaces over black

Contrast and accessibility
- Body text on dark meets WCAG 2.2 AA targets; large CTAs exceed minimums
- Focus rings are clearly visible on all interactive elements
- Icons are always paired with text or an aria-label to avoid color-only cues

### Interaction and validation
- Date pickers block past dates and enforce start not after end on both client and server
- Required fields are validated inline and errors are announced to assistive tech
- After submit, the confirmation keeps context and offers a clear next step

## Agile methodology
I worked in a simple Kanban flow (To do ‚Üí In progress ‚Üí Done) using GitHub Issues and a GitHub Projects board. I kept stories small with acceptance criteria, merged related work into epics, and aimed for a fast MVP, then iteration.

process
- planned user stories on the board (To do ‚Üí In progress ‚Üí Done)
- wrote acceptance criteria first, then adjusted tasks after the first implementation spike
- shipped in short increments to Heroku and noted a tiny retro each time (keep, change, try)
- used MoSCoW to keep scope honest

epics I used
- auth and sessions
- booking flow (offer cards, form, validation, confirmation)
- my bookings (list, edit, delete)
- admin operations (manage bookings via Django admin, cleanup, light exports)
- accessibility and performance (contrast, focus rings, asset sizing)
- platform setup and deployment (installation, project setup, Heroku deploy)
- foundational UI (home/landing page and navigation)

example user story and acceptance criteria
- as a user I can select a booking service, fill the form, and send my inquiry so that I can receive the service I need
  - acceptance criterion 1: the booking offer is visible and reachable
  - acceptance criterion 2: the form validates and submits correctly
  - acceptance criterion 3: after submit, the booking appears in My Bookings

prioritisation (MoSCoW)
- must have: authentication, Offer ‚Üí Booking flow, My Bookings CRUD, basic admin visibility
- should have: category management in admin, clearer field hints, high-contrast theme and keyboard navigation
- could have: quick quotes, saved organizations, better exports, richer empty states
- won‚Äôt have in this release: messaging, staff profiles/ratings, availability calendars, multi-tenant features

## Testing

Testing was woven into every step of Roho‚Äôs development ‚Äî because ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù isn‚Äôt a QA strategy. While we didn‚Äôt write Django `TestCase` unit tests (yet), **manual testing drove the project to rock-solid reliability**.

### Test Environment

Local: macOS, Python 3.12, Django 5.2, Chrome & Safari

Prod: Heroku (Gunicorn + WhiteNoise)

Branching: feature branches ‚Üí PRs after passing lint & checks

### Manual Testing Overview

- **Authentication Workflow**  
  - Registration, login, logout, and session persistence  
  - Navbar links updating correctly for logged-in vs. guest users  
- **Booking System**  
  - Create, read, update, and delete bookings  
  - Date-picker validation (no time machines allowed ‚Äî past dates are blocked)  
- **Form & UX Validation**  
  - JavaScript checks for required fields, valid staff counts, and future dates  
  - Backend re-validation in Django to catch anything that slipped past the client  
- **Navigation & Layout**  
  - Consistent header/footer across all pages  
  - Responsive behavior on desktop, tablet, and (lightning-fast) mobile
Core User Flows

Register / Login / Logout ‚Äî forms render with Bootstrap, errors shown inline, login redirects correctly.

Book a Service ‚Äî required fields enforced; start_date cannot be in the past; end_date must be on/after start_date.

Edit Booking ‚Äî prefilled values; validation still enforced on update.

My Bookings ‚Äî lists only the signed-in user‚Äôs bookings; Edit/Delete work as expected.

Validation & Error States

Server-side errors surfaced below fields; clear copy for date rules and required inputs.


Access Control

Anonymous users attempting to access protected pages are redirected to the Login page.

Staff-only actions are restricted to the Django admin.

Navigation & Links

Header/nav consistent; all internal links route correctly; external links open in a new tab with rel="noopener".

Console

No client-side errors during normal flows.

Historical: a brief production 500 on /accounts/register/ during early deploy (fixed ‚Äî see below).


### üêç Python (PEP 8)
- **Linting:** Used **flake8** and VS Code‚Äôs built-in linter to enforce style.  
- **Checks performed:**  
  - Maximum line length  
  - Proper function/class names (snake_case & CamelCase)  
  - Consistent indentation and whitespace  
  - Removal of unused imports and variables

  ![Testing](static/images/docs/testingpy.png)  

### üìú JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Validation:** Ran **JSHint** (configured with `esversion: 6`) on all custom scripts.  
- **Checks performed:**  
  - No undefined variables  
  - Required semicolons (where needed)  
  - Logical flow and syntax correctness  

### üåê HTML5 & CSS3
- **HTML:** Passed through the **W3C Markup Validator** ‚Äî only minor warnings about self-closing tags.  
![Testing](static/images/docs/warning.png) 
![Testing](static/images/docs/nuaftercheck.png) 
- **CSS:** Verified with the **W3C CSS Validator** ‚Äî zero errors; responsive media queries all clear. 
![Testing](static/images/docs/cssvalidation.png) 
- **Responsive rules:** Ensured flexible layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Root / homepage ‚Äî clean

Warnings that were fixed
‚ÄúSection lacks heading‚Äù ‚Üí added <h2> where meaningful or replaced decorative <section> with <div>.


‚ÄúTrailing slash on void elements‚Äù ‚Üí removed self-closing slashes from void elements (due flake it is coming back over and over again)

### Bugs & Fixes
1) Date Picker ‚Äî duplicate icon & invalid ranges

Symptoms

Two calendar icons visible on date inputs.

Users could select past dates / end_date before start_date.

Cause

Legacy CSS calendar background conflicting with the native type="date" control. Frontend fix done.

### Lighthouse Testing

Lighthouse audits were run on the deployed Heroku app using Chrome DevTools for both Mobile and Desktop modes.

How we ran it

Open the site in Chrome ‚Üí DevTools ‚Üí Lighthouse tab.

Mode: Navigation ‚Ä¢ Categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO

Device: run twice ‚Äî Mobile (throttled) and Desktop.

Make sure the page is served as production (no dev toolbars), then click Analyze.

For CI-style rechecks, you can also use PageSpeed Insights with the deployed URL.

## Deployment

For good practice, this project was deployed early to Heroku
to surface integration issues (static files, databases, security settings) as soon as possible.

The project runs on Django 5.2. Development used the default SQLite database; production uses PostgreSQL. Heroku offers a Postgres add-on; alternatively you can use any hosted Postgres. This guide shows Heroku Postgres, but the steps are the same if you supply a DATABASE_URL from another provider.

Example Heroku app name used below: roho-3cab264b3559 (replace with your own).

<details> <summary>Steps taken before deploying the project to Heroku</summary>
### Create the Heroku App

Log into Heroku ‚Üí New ‚Üí Create new app.

Choose a unique name (e.g. roho-3cab264b3559) and region Europe.

Click Create app.

### Add a PostgreSQL Database

Option A (recommended): Heroku Postgres

App ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí search Heroku Postgres ‚Üí Hobby Dev ‚Äì Free.

Option B: external Postgres

Provision externally and keep the full DATABASE_URL ready (e.g. postgres://...).

### Create env.py for local development

Keep secrets out of Git. Add env.py to .gitignore.

### Update settings.py
Make the app env-aware and wire up the DB + static files and run initial migrations locally.

### Procfile & runtime
At the repository root (same level as manage.py):
web: gunicorn roho.wsgi
