## Overview

Roho Booking Service is the secret weapon for event managers and creative agencies who need to book staff ‚Äî and book them *fast*. Whether you‚Äôre curating a gallery opening, orchestrating a fair, or just trying to staff your next big show, Roho‚Äôs got your back. Think of it as Tinder for top-notch event staff (minus the awkward swiping).

**Target audience**
- üè¢ Agencies that organize events
- üé® Art directors and gallery curators
- üéâ Fair and festival coordinators
- üíº Anyone who has ever said, ‚ÄúWhy is booking people so complicated?‚Äù

## UX Design

### Strategy plane
I originally designed Roho as a full talent marketplace with multi-service booking, profiles, ratings, messaging, and availability calendars. Because of the timeline, I applied Agile scoping and shipped an MVP that solves the essential job end-to-end: discover the service, submit a booking, review/edit/delete it, and let an admin triage entries. The larger concept stays on the roadmap.

### Site goals
- Deliver a fast, low-friction path from landing to confirmed booking
- Keep the interface predictable and consistent on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Use high contrast and clear hierarchy for easy reading
- Give admins simple oversight to keep data clean
- Leave room for growth without redesigning the core

### Scope and Agile decisions (MVP)
- **Kept:** authentication, Offer ‚Üí Booking flow, My Bookings with CRUD, basic admin visibility  
- **Deferred:** staff profiles, messaging, calendar availability, quotes, multi-tenant agencies  
- **Process:** small user stories with acceptance criteria, Kanban flow, demoable increments

### User stories

**Admin / business owner**
- As an admin, I want to view all bookings so that I can manage schedules and data integrity.
- As an admin, I want to edit or delete any booking so that I can correct mistakes or remove duplicates.
- As an admin, I want to manage service categories so that I can adjust the offer.

**Visitor / guest**
- As a visitor, I want to understand the service at a glance so that I know if this solves my problem.
- As a visitor, I want clear navigation to Book Now and Register so that I can start immediately.
- As a visitor, I want responsive pages on mobile, tablet, and desktop so that I can use the site anywhere.

**New user**
- As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can submit bookings.
- As a new user, I want helpful form hints and validation so that I can complete registration without confusion.

**Logged-in user**
- As a user, I want to log in and out reliably so that my account stays secure.
- As a user, I want to choose a service from the Offer page and go straight to the correct booking form so that I don‚Äôt get lost.
- As a user, I want to submit a booking with event details, dates, and number of people so that the team can staff my event.
- As a user, I want the form to prevent past dates and enforce start before end so that my booking is valid.
- As a user, I want a clear confirmation after submitting so that I know it worked.
- As a user, I want to see my bookings in My Bookings so that I can review them at any time.
- As a user, I want to edit an existing booking with the form pre-filled so that I can fix small mistakes quickly.
- As a user, I want to delete a booking I no longer need so that I don‚Äôt clutter the system.

### UX research and market scan
I compared event-staffing and booking platforms to see which fields they request, how fast a user can submit, how availability/pricing is communicated, and where drop-offs happen.

**Sample and method**  
Comparative teardown of agency sites, self-serve tools, and marketplace job boards across DE/EU/US. I captured flows, forms, copy, and interface patterns, then tagged items by friction level, clarity, and mobile behavior.

![Competitive scan](static/images/docs/comparison.png)

**Key patterns**
- Many ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù flows ask for too many fields before trust is built.
- Mobile usability varies; some forms are cramped and error handling is vague.

**What I adopted**
- One clear path: Offer ‚Üí Booking form ‚Üí confirmation
- Minimal required fields with strong hints and inline validation

### Information architecture
- **Navbar:** Home ‚Ä¢ Book Now ‚Ä¢ My Bookings ‚Ä¢ Login/Logout
- **Primary flows:**
  1. Offer ‚Üí Booking form ‚Üí confirmation  
  2. My Bookings ‚Üí Edit/Delete  
  3. Admin at `/admin/` ‚Üí review and clean up
- **Copy:** short action labels and one clear CTA per section

### Wireframes and design evolution
- Wireframes: a simple path from Home to Book to My Bookings with centered forms and visible CTAs  
  ![Wireframes](static/images/docs/wireframes.png)
- Early MVP screens: Offer cards, Booking form, Sign-up/Sign-in, and My Bookings list  
  ![MVP Screens](static/images/docs/Booking.png)
- First large landing concept (pre-scope cut): editorial hero blocks, multiple service areas, and a banner callout  
  ![Initial Landing Concept](static/images/docs/rohohomepage.png)

I trimmed the large landing to keep speed and clarity for the MVP while keeping the visual language ready for future expansion.

### Visual design and color system
A modern, high-contrast palette so actions are easy to notice and the interface works well for users who need more contrast.

- Pitch black: app background for maximum contrast  
- White: primary text on dark  
- Electric/mint green: primary CTAs, focus rings, active accents  
- Soft violet: secondary accents, icons, card tints  
- Brand accent: highlights and emphasis states  
- Dark greys: elevated panels and form surfaces over black

**Contrast and accessibility**
- Body text on dark meets WCAG 2.2 AA; large CTAs exceed minimums.
- Focus rings are clearly visible on all interactive elements.
- Icons are paired with text or `aria-label` so color alone isn‚Äôt the cue.

### Interaction and validation
- Date pickers block past dates and enforce start ‚â§ end on client and server.
- Required fields validate inline; errors are clear and actionable.
- After submit, the confirmation keeps context and offers a next step.

## Agile Methodology

I worked in a simple Kanban flow (To do ‚Üí In progress ‚Üí Done) using GitHub Issues and a GitHub Projects board. I kept stories small with acceptance criteria, grouped related work into epics, and aimed for a fast MVP followed by iteration.

**Process**
- Planned user stories on the board (To do ‚Üí In progress ‚Üí Done)
- Wrote acceptance criteria first; adjusted tasks after the first spike
- Shipped in short increments to Heroku with tiny retros (keep/change/try)
- Used MoSCoW to keep scope honest

**Epics**
- Auth and sessions  
- Booking flow (offer cards, form, validation, confirmation)  
- My bookings (list, edit, delete)  
- Admin operations (manage via Django admin, cleanup, light exports)  
- Accessibility and performance (contrast, focus rings, asset sizing)  
- Platform setup and deployment (installation, project setup, Heroku deploy)  
- Foundational UI (home/landing and navigation)

**Example user story**
- As a user I can select a booking service, fill the form, and send my inquiry so that I can receive the service I need.  
  - Criterion 1: the booking offer is visible and reachable  
  - Criterion 2: the form validates and submits correctly  
  - Criterion 3: after submit, the booking appears in My Bookings

**Prioritization (MoSCoW)**
- **Must have:** authentication, Offer ‚Üí Booking flow, My Bookings CRUD, admin visibility  
- **Should have:** category management in admin, clearer field hints, high-contrast theme and keyboard navigation  
- **Could have:** quick quotes, saved organizations, better exports, richer empty states  
- **Won‚Äôt have (this release):** messaging, staff profiles/ratings, availability calendars, multi-tenant features

## Testing

I approached testing in layers: validators and linters ‚Üí manual functional tests (happy path + edge cases) ‚Üí accessibility checks ‚Üí performance audits ‚Üí cross-browser/device sanity checks. I recorded defects and fixes, and I kept the validators clean on the deployed build.

### Test environments

- **Local**: macOS, Python 3.12, Django 5.2, Chrome 139, Safari 17  
- **Staging/Prod**: Heroku (Gunicorn + WhiteNoise, PostgreSQL)  
- **Branching**: feature branches ‚Üí PRs after lint/validators pass

---

### 1) Static analysis & validators

**Python (PEP 8)**
- Tools: `flake8` + VS Code linter  
- Checks: max line length, naming, whitespace/indentation, unused imports/vars  
![Python lint](static/images/docs/testingpy.png)

**JavaScript (ES6+)**
- Tool: **JSHint** (`esversion: 6`)  
- Checks: undefined vars, missing semicolons where required, control flow

**HTML & CSS**
- **W3C Nu HTML Checker**: fixed all errors and actionable warnings
  - Added `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html lang="en">` in `base.html`
  - Ensured a single `<title>` in `<head>`
  - Replaced decorative `<section>` with `<div>` or added visually hidden `<h2>` to satisfy ‚Äúsection needs heading‚Äù
  - Removed trailing slashes on void elements (`<img>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`)
  - Fixed Django template output that the validator saw as raw `{% ... %}` by validating the deployed pages, not raw templates
  - Corrected `<time datetime="...">` to valid ISO dates where used or replaced with plain text
  - Removed inline `aria-describedby="id_*_help"` strings that accidentally rendered as text
  - Ensured all anchor `href` values are real URLs on the rendered page, not template tags
  - Example warnings addressed:  
    ![Nu HTML warnings](static/images/docs/warning.png)  
    ![Nu HTML after](static/images/docs/nuaftercheck.png)

- **W3C CSS Validator**: zero errors after cleanup  
  ![CSS validation](static/images/docs/cssvalidation.png)

---

### 2) Functional manual testing

I tested each feature on local and on the deployed Heroku app. Below are the core scenarios with pass criteria.

**Authentication**
- Register ‚Üí success message, auto-login (where configured) or redirect to Login ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Logout ‚Üí sessions expire correctly
- Nav changes with auth state (Login/Logout/My Bookings visibility)

**Booking flow**
- Offer ‚Üí Book form preselects/keeps context
- **Validation rules**
  - Required fields enforced with clear inline errors
  - `start_date` cannot be in the past (HTML `min` + server validation)
  - `end_date` must be same day or after `start_date`
  - People ‚â• 1; Hours ‚â• 1; Budget accepts numbers only
- Successful submit shows confirmation and the booking appears in **My Bookings**

**My Bookings**
- Only the signed-in user‚Äôs bookings are shown
- **Edit** opens the same form with prefilled data; validation still enforced
- **Delete** shows a confirm screen and removes only the selected booking

**Admin**
- `/admin/` lists bookings; staff can search, edit, and delete
- Category/offer list manageable via Django admin

**Negative/edge cases**
- Direct access to protected URLs when logged out ‚Üí redirected to Login
- Tampering with IDs in edit/delete URLs ‚Üí 404/permission denied for other users‚Äô objects
- Submitting with JS disabled ‚Üí server-side validation still blocks bad input
- Large notes field; overly long company names/emails ‚Üí form errors as expected

| Validation  | CSS (Jigsaw)       | Validate stylesheet                     | 0 errors                                      | ‚úÖ     |

---

### 3) Accessibility

**Keyboard**
- All controls reachable in logical order; visible focus outlines (Bootstrap + custom high-contrast focus ring)
- Skip repetitive nav by predictable structure; no keyboard traps

**Semantics**
- One `<h1>` per page; meaningful `<h2>` structure (visually hidden where needed)
- Form labels bound via `for`/`id` pairs; helpful error text appears next to fields

**Color/contrast**
- Text and interactive elements meet **WCAG 2.2 AA** on dark background

**Automated checks**
- **Lighthouse** (A11y category) and **axe DevTools**: no critical issues

---

### 4) Performance (Lighthouse)

- Audited Home, Offer, Book form, and My Bookings on **Mobile** and **Desktop** in Chrome DevTools (Navigation mode; Performance, A11y, Best Practices, SEO)

| Device   | Perf | A11y | Best | SEO |
|----------|------|------|------|-----|
| Mobile   | 96   | 100  | 100  | 91  |
| Desktop  | 100  | 100  | 100  | 91  |

![Lighthouse Mobile](static/images/docs/lighthouse1.png)  
![Lighthouse Desktop](static/images/docs/lighthouse2.png)

**Perf notes**
- Static assets served via WhiteNoise; images sized and compressed
- Avoided blocking scripts; Bootstrap from CDN with SRI

---

### 5) Browser/device checks

- **Desktop**: Chrome 139, Safari 17 ‚Äî layout and forms work as expected
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari (via device + Responsively App) ‚Äî form controls usable; no horizontal scroll; safe tap targets

---
**Warnings fixed**

- ‚ÄúSection lacks heading‚Äù ‚Üí added meaningful `<h2>` or replaced decorative `<section>` with `<div>`  
- ‚ÄúTrailing slash on void elements‚Äù ‚Üí removed self-closing slashes on `<img>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`  
- Ensured `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html lang="en">`, and a single `<title>` in `base.html`  
- Validated that anchors render real URLs (not raw `{% url %}`) and that template tags resolve in production

---

### Bugs & Fixes

1) **Date picker: duplicate icon & invalid ranges**  
   **Symptoms:** Two calendar icons on `type="date"` inputs; past dates selectable; `end_date` could be before `start_date`.  
   **Cause:** Legacy CSS background image overlapping the native control + missing constraints.  
   **Fix:** Removed background, set HTML `min` on both date fields, enforced rules server-side.

---

### 6) Defect log (examples)

1. **Date inputs showed two calendar icons**  
   **Cause**: legacy CSS background over native `type="date"`  
   **Fix**: removed background image; kept native picker; enforced `min` on both fields

2. **Nu HTML errors on templates**  
   **Cause**: validating raw templates showed `{% url %}` / `{% static %}` as literal text  
   **Fix**: validated the rendered Heroku pages; ensured `base.html` had `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html lang>`, single `<title>`, and proper headings

3. **Validator warning ‚Äúsection lacks heading‚Äù**  
   **Fix**: added semantic `<h2>` (visually hidden where purely decorative) or used `<div>`

---

### 7) What‚Äôs next

- Add automated **Django `TestCase`** coverage for bookings CRUD and permissions
- Add **Playwright** smoke tests for the core flows
- Track Lighthouse scores in CI on main after deploy
